# TnQA_Bot_MC

Part of the TnQA Telegram Bot that allows user to perform Monte Carlo simulations by passing the command from chat screen, allowing access to a predictive model even away from the computer. 

You can just create a "token" and "user_id" for a Telegram Bot (BotFather recommended for ease of use) and modify the code. Then simply run in Anaconda CMD by passing the command "python MC_Telegram.py" and let it work in the background.
